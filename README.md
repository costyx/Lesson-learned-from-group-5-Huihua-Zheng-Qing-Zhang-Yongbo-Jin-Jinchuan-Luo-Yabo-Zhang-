How to hire and define qualified programmer

One of the takeaway from the class is the how to find a qualified programmer and offers him what he deserves. Qualified programmers are the key for the business, especially for people who start the business but do not know anything about programming and coding. After taking the class and read the book, I gained some insights about the criteria and requirement.

First of all, background and experience are very important. If the programmer graduated from Stanford and used to work for Google or Facebook, it certainly tells that he is very capable of programming and coding. However, how to persuade him changing from such stable companies with good fame to a dynamic start-up environment is a challenge for us. If the programmers used to work for major tech start-ups, it not only proves his good capability but also shows that he likes start-up dynamic environment. 

However, education background and work experience isn’t everything; a qualified programmer also needs to have some of the key characteristics. Since technology is keeping changing dramatically, a qualified programmer needs to have the instinct of technologies, and always willing to learn new things. He should be an early adopter and a faster adapter. When given something new, he can grasp it quickly and integrate it with the rest of your knowledge.

In additional to that, a qualified programmer should be a critical thinker. He rarely takes things as given without first getting the facts. When people say "because that's the way it's done," or a vendor promises the solution to all your problems, he should smell a challenge, and he needs to have the broad knowledge and able to take new challenges. 

What is also very important is that he should not be afraid to admit ignorance or error. It's not the most pleasant aspect of programming, but it will happen—even on the best of projects. Despite thorough testing, good documentation, and solid automation, things could still go wrong: deliveries are late or unforeseen technical problems come up. These things could always happen, and programmers should deal with them as professionally as they can. This means being honest and direct, he can be proud of our abilities, but he must be honest about the shortcomings—the ignorance as well as the mistakes.
