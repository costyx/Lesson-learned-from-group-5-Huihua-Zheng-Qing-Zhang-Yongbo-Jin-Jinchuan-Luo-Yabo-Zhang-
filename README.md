A well-designed, well-written software requirement specifiation accomplishes four major goals:
1. It provides feedback to the customer. 
2. It decomposes the problem into component parts. 
3. It serves as an input to the design specification. 
4. It serves as the parent document for testing and validation strategies that will be applied to the requirements for verification.

Key principles:
1. Compare and contrast various methods for documentation/communication of your software requirements.
2. Find out possible pitfalls in the communication chain.
3. Develop a communication strategy that everyone you work with will know and understand.
